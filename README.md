# Before diving in

Note that this is a collection or, compilation of all of the stuff that I needed in learning Design Analysis of Algorithms. Starting from University lectures, MIT resources, Blogs, Books, etc. Whatever, that I needed is recorded or, stored here in form of actual files or links to the resources, references, etc. Lastly, the important bits from all of those resources are written in a LaTeX file.

## Resources types

The following are all of the resources types that this repository has

1. TeX file
2. PDFs
